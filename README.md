I hope you enjoy the app and any comments on code or improvments I always happy to implement otherwise enjoy :)

# General Usage

Once you are on the sign up page when running the app. If you have an account log in with your username and password. However, if you do not have an account click on the 'create account' tab, fill in the form, submit it, then you may progress to the next stage.

On accessing the /suppliers route you should see a list of all the suppliers from the api and below that a list of the quotes from the supplies as well.

If you would like to see more information about a given supplier click on the 'See more' button and it will provide you with the description of the supplier and the supplier code.

# Future development

1: Pagination of the supplier and quotes is needed to be developed and implemented.
2: Add a log out feature.

# Issues

1: Can still add an invalid email address such as stephen@yoyo.com - Althought this is not a required field it would be reviewed in more detail for production to ensure correct domain email address are used
